Last updated: November 19, 2025

## Configuration Fixed ✅

- Next.js configuration updated for v15.5.6
- Deprecated `experimental.turbo` moved to `turbopack`
- Vercel.json cleaned up
- Environment variables organized

## Next Steps

1. Add environment variables in Vercel Dashboard
2. Verify deployment success
3. Test live site functionality

Build should now succeed with proper environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard.
